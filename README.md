# Credit Risk Analysis: Unsupervised Machine Learning 
## Overview
### The objective of this exercise was to use an unsupervised machine learning module to sort out a large unbalanced data set of loans to predict which ones would be considered "good", where they would be paid back and "high risk", which would mean they would be likely defaulted. Bother oversampling and undersampling algorithms were conducted for this data set.
## Results
### First the null values were dropped out of the data set so that the algorims would work correctly. A " High Risk" loan status was assigned to any loan with a status in the following:
- Late (31-120 days)
- Late (16-30 days)
- Default
- In Grace Period
### If a loan did not meet this critera, it was considered a "good" low risk loan.
